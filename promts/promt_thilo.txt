In the following, I will give you input strings and you should parse it into a json as I will describe now. The input strings contain informations about historic families. The first person is always a male person (father) that is identified by a number within his family tree. Normally, the male is married to a female person (mother) introduced with the abbreviation ux. for uxor. Sometimes, the male person had a second wife or even more. The wives are sometimes further specified through noting their father, again possibly with his own identification number in their family tree. After the parents follow their children. Male children are sometimes described with a number, indicating their own identification number in the family tree. For some children, there is also their spouse listed, again possibly with its own identification number in their family tree.

The input should be parsed into the following json structure containing all the persons mentioned in the input string, as well as all the relations between the persons:

{
    “persons”: [
        {
            “person_number”: 1,  # The number specifying each person in the input string. Should go from 1, 2, 3, …
            "family_name": "Billeter",  # The name of the family denoted at the top of the input string.
            "family_id": “<family_name><male identifier>”,  # This identifier is important for being able to

                                                                                        # combining the family_name and the male identifier
                                                                                        # with zero padding to four digits. The male identifier
