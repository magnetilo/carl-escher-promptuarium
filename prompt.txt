# Transcribing Instructions for Genealogical Data (Based on Carl Keller-Escher’s Promptuarium Genealogicum)

1. **Headings**:
   - Use family names as headings.
   - Center the family name by applying the "center" alignment.
   - After the family name, insert a horizontal line.

2. **Text Formatting**:
   - Follow the layout of the original text closely, but prioritize logical readability.
   - Do not transcribe page numbers from the original document.

3. **Abbreviations**:
   - Leave all abbreviations as they appear in the source material.
   - Common abbreviations:
     - `ux.` for wife/wives (Latin: uxor/uxores).
     - `m.` for husband (Latin: maritus).
     - `V.D.M.` for pastor (Latin: Verbi divini minister).
     - Currency abbreviations: `lb` for libra (pound) and `ẞ` for Schilling.

4. **Paragraphs and Line Breaks**:
   - Every new line in the original document should be a new line in the transcription.
   - Use paragraph breaks as they appear in the original, applying line breaks where necessary.
   - If the original text is indented or part of a list, mimic that formatting by indenting the text accordingly.

5. **Numbered Lists**:
   - Use numbered lists when family members are listed with numbers. Do not modify or add numbering.
   - If the numbering includes a period (e.g., 1.), and you do not want it recognized as a numbered list in your tool, add a backslash (e.g., `1\.`) to prevent automatic formatting.

6. **Special Formatting**:
   - If text is indented in the original, replicate this by using indentation in the transcription.
   - Indentations can be created by using the ">" symbol at the beginning of the line.
   - For nested indentations, use multiple ">" symbols (e.g., `>>`, `>>>`).

7. **Text Annotations**:
   - Text that appears on the left side of the original document (annotations, additions) should be integrated into the transcription at the correct spot.
   - Surround such annotations with a horizontal line (`---`) and place the annotation within square brackets.
   - Example:
     ```
     ---
     [Note on left side: Additional information here.]
     ---
     ```

8. **Footnotes and Special Notes**:
   - For footnotes or special notes in the original document, add them using a numbered footnote system.
   - Use the following format for footnotes:
     - In the main text: `[^fn1]`
     - At the bottom of the page: `[^fn1]: Footnote content here.`
   - If a genealogical tree or diagram appears in the document, note its presence with: `[Stammbaumdarstellung]`.

9. **Unclear Text**:
   - If certain words are difficult to read or unclear:
     - Use square brackets with a question mark to indicate uncertainty: `[uncertain word?]`.
     - If only certain letters are unclear, use dots for each missing letter: `e.g., [H...r]`.
     - For longer unclear sections, use three dots: `[...]`.

10. **Special Characters**:
   - If special characters like asterisks (*) or plus signs (+) are used for dates, precede them with a backslash to avoid special formatting: `\*1742`, `\+1742`.
   - For symbols like † (death), use the following keyboard shortcuts:
     - Backslash: `Alt Gr + >/<` or `Alt + 92`
     - Dagger (†): `Alt + 0134`
     - Scharfes S (ß): `Alt + 0223`

11. **Submitting Transcriptions**:
   - Once a page is completed, submit it for review by clicking the appropriate button in the tool (for example, "Submit to Editor" or similar depending on your CLI tool).

12. **General Tips**:
   - Follow the layout as much as possible, but ensure the transcribed text remains logical and readable.
   - Consistency is key, especially with formatting and handling annotations.

The output should be in a custom JSON format. It should contain data for persons like so:

{
id:UUID
name_geboren: SURNAME
name_geheiratet: SURNAME or NONE
vorname: GIVEN NAME
geboren: DATE
gestorben: DATE
beruf: PROFESSION
TODO:  family_id: LASTNAME OF FATHER AND INDEX NUMBER
TODO:  father_family_id: 
}

There should also be dataabout relations like so:

{
id: UUID
node_id_from: UUID OF FIRST ENTITY
node_id_to: UUID OF SECOND ENTITY
relation: FATHER_CHILD OR HUSBAND_WIFE OR MOTHER_CHILD
}

Be careful to note:

- "der Pfister" is not part of a name. It means "baker".
- People indented under another person are considered their children. They have the same surname.
- "ux." means "uxor" and designates the following person to be married to the above person.
- "Zftr." designates the membership in a "Zunft". The following year is the year when the person joined the Zunft.
- Give UUIDs as identifiers to prevent name collisions.
- The number at the beginning of a line before a man's name is to identify that person.
- "Hs." is an abbreviation for the given name "Hans".
- "Pfr." is an abbreciation for the profession "Pfarrer".
